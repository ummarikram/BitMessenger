# BitMessenger

BitMessenger is a decentralized messenger app built on the stacks ecosystem. It uses Clarity for the smart contract and nextJS for the front-end development.

## NOTE

* This is still in early production phase and needs huge optimization as all data is stored on the blockchain which is not feasible.
* For future reference, data needs to be stored off-chain on Gia hub for fast retrieval and less load on blockchain.

## INSTRUCTIONS

* Run in terminal: npm install
* Run in terminal: npm run dev
* Navigate to: https://localhost:3000
